# TODO: Kozmik Fısıltı Feature Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add `spontaneousCommentWithAI` function to `src/services/geminiModerator.ts`
- [x] Import `spontaneousCommentWithAI` in `pages/ChatPage.tsx`
- [x] Integrate random AI comment logic in `sendMessage` function (15% chance after moderation passes)

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the chat to ensure AI comments appear randomly on clean messages without disrupting normal flow
- [ ] Verify that violations prevent any AI comments
- [ ] Monitor for any performance issues or errors in production
